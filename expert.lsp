                ***** EXPERT.LSP *****

This file is the functions of expert system based on MYCIN.
Rules are fired and a certainty factor is provided in a rage of -1.0 and 1.0.

The original codes were provided by Dr. Weiss. Functions were edited so that they deal with CF.

14/04/18 - diagnose edited
14/04/20 - minor modifications
14/04/22 - debug for CF calculation

The following notes come from the originalsource file.
---------------------------------------------------------
"Toy" expert system routines from Chapter 18 of Winston and Horn LISP text
(1st edition, Addison-Wesley, 1981).

This code illustrates both forward and backward chaining expert system approaches.

Usage:
Code runs automatically upon loading.
(initialize)	- initializes global variables
(deduce)	- runs forward chaining expert system
(diagnose)	- runs backward chaining expert system
(how <fact>)	- explains how <fact> was inferred
(why <fact>)	- explains why <fact> was needed

Modifications (John M. Weiss, Ph.D.)
11/25/98 - Rewrote and reformatted much of the archaic Lisp code.
11/25/98 - Removed interactive queries for more info.
04/04/07 - More code cleanups.
